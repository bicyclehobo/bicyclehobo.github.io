<p>Every since I was a young boy I have slept with the covers pulled up and over my head. Completely covered by the blanket. When I am unable to do this I often position a pillow so it covers the top of my head all the way to the tip of my nose so that just my nose and mouth are exposed. I have no explanation for this and have been derided by every single girlfriend who was witness to this behavior. Sleeping in a bivy sack comes quite naturally to me.</p>

<p>I had never even seen a bivy sack until about 2000. I have a good deal of experience with tents and tarps but upon first seeing the bivy I knew it was for me. It is an oft debated topic online that gets clouded by opinion. Words like &#8220;claustrophobia&#8221;, &#8220;restrictive&#8221;, &#8220;breathability&#8221;, and &#8220;condensation&#8221; get tossed around, people profess an almost kinship to materials, bug netting and pole structure get involved sometimes to a point where it is no longer a bivy and more of a tent, and they all further take us away from the one truth involved. Some people have the bivy-suited personality and some just do not. I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue that the bivy isn&#8217;t a great emergency shelter for all. I just see a certain slice of the hiking-camping-cycling-whatever community that doesn&#8217;t truly appreciate the bivy sack. I don&#8217;t expect to convince anyone because my strongest point is &#8220;It just feels right&#8221; which is immediately countered by the opposite sentiment. So I feel quite lucky in being able to say that this lightweight, poless, non staking, instant shelter &#8212; &#8220;just feels right&#8221; to me and I love them. Let me break down why.</p>

<h2>Space/weight factor of a bivy sack</h2>

<p>The heaviest bivy I have ever used was the 15 ounce <a href="../rei-minimalist-bivy-sack-review/index.html" title="Rei Minimalist Bivy Sack Review">Rei Minimalist Bivy Sack</a> and packs down to the size of a 5X8&#8242; tarp. I see bivys online that are below 7 ounces that pack down even smaller. By eliminating a tent I can also eliminate the need to use large pannier bags so the weight savings here is compounded and bolstered by reducing air drafting. The heaviest bivy I would consider is the <a title="Salathe Bivy sack" href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=683" target="_blank">Integral Designs Salathe Bivy sack</a> that comes in at 2.1lbs. Ideally I would like to see someone take the design of this bivy and make it using a lightweight material with less zippers. The closest thing I have seen to this is the <a title="zpacks bivy sack" href="http://zpacks.com/shelter/bivy.shtml" target="_blank">Zpacks bivy sack</a> that weighs in at 6.3 ounces with the detachable mess screen.</p>

<h2>Flexibility of a bivy sack</h2>

<p>The Bivy is part of a sleeping system that I am creating. It is simply a sleeping bag, sleeping pad, 5X8&#8242; tarp, ground cloth, and a bivy. This allows me to dial in the protection I need based on the weather conditions and space I have to make camp in. It takes minutes for me to set up my complete campsite. If I don&#8217;t need a tarp I can set camp in less than 2 minutes. I am going to add a layer of bug protection to the mix in my next point.</p>

<h2>Bug Protection with a bivy sack</h2>

<p>I like having a mesh no-see-um screen to keep the bugs away on the bivy but after looking at <a title="Mountain Laurel Designs bug bivy" href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=55" target="_blank">Mountain Laurel Designs bug bivy</a> I am thinking that the amount of comfort added for an additional 5-6 ounces works. This would integrate into my tarp set up well and would allow me behave as if I were in a small tent reading, looking at maps, even washing up using my <a title="Hygiene on Bicycle Tour" href="../hygiene-on-bicycle-tour/index.html" target="_blank">Hygiene Kit</a>. The <a title="Six Moon Designs Meteor bivy" href="http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/bivy/meteor.html" target="_blank">Six Moon Designs Meteor bivy</a> seems to offer a lightweight combination bug shelter and waterproof foot-box. <a title="Oware bug netting" href="http://shop.bivysack.com/product.sc?productId=75&categoryId=2" target="_blank">Oware bug netting </a>could also be integrated into my system but it doesn&#8217;t seem as roomy as the Mountain Laurel Designs product. I could also just buy a standard &#8216;bug net&#8217; and tuck it into my existing bivy to kind of create a &#8216;Poor Mans&#8217; Meteor style bivy.</p>

<h2>Added Warmth of a bivy sack</h2>

<p>I use a fairly light bag and appreciate the extra warmth the bivy gives me. They say it can add up to 10 degrees of warmth.</p>

<p>I am in the process of looking at new bivy sacks for an upcoming adventure. Poles are out. I would like mosquito netting. Breathability and weight factor into the equation. Most of the camping it will be used in will be +40 Fahrenheit and I will pair it with a tarp as an outer shelter. I am in the process of researching and will share the final results as I prep for my next trip. I will take a lot into consideration before I purchase, but I know that I am happy and comfortable while in a bivy and that is the main issue here. I can make this decision because I know the facts about how I am.</p>

<p>If you have never spent the night in a bivy sack I would borrow one from a friend. A good first step would be trying to sleep with the covers pulled over your head. I just get happy saying bivy sack! Bivy sack :).</p>
