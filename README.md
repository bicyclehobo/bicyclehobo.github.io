<p>This is my HTML5 static BicycleHobo.com staging area.</p>
<p>Previously I was on <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> but this is a very simple site. I have made a mess of it with over categorization and willy nilly tagging. Time to clean things up, move back to an HTML5 build, and rely a bit more on social channels to update.
