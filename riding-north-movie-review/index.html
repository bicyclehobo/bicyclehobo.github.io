<p><b>I wanted to add to my review below as I missed something about this movie when watching it the first couple times. This is not only a movie about bicycle touring. It is a celebration of Canada. The soundtrack really grew on me and after looking up the individual artists involved I came to look at the movie in a different light. Regardless it is a great job and well worth the price of download.</b></p>

<p>I recently came across a low budget film titled <a href="http://www.ridingnorthmovie.com" target="_blank">&#8220;Riding North&#8221; &#8211; http://www.ridingnorthmovie.com</a>, a film that centers on a 30-day bike tour through the Yukon and North West Territories. The filmmakers, Steve Langston, Chris Mitchell and Ryan Mitchell, are very upfront about a $0 budget and for the $7.00 USD I shelled out I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>First off let me say I&#8217;m skewed as a critic. You could put me in front of any media focusing on bicycle touring and I would come away feeling as if it was time well spent. A bike trip through Yukon and the North West Territories is commendable and I was really excited to invest the time in watching their journey. I read about it at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/17k39l/riding_north_httpwwwridingnorthmoviecom/" target="_blank">reddit</a>  and immediately downloaded the movie for $7.</p>
<p>Executive Producer Steve Langston, and Directors Chris Mitchell and Ryan Mitchell admit to having no expectations when they first decided to make a movie about a 2,000 kilometre, 30-day bike tour in some extremely remote areas of Canada. &#8220;When we started out Steve didn&#8217;t know much about film making and we didn’t know anything about biking, so we were just in way over our heads which is a big reason I think it turned out so well,&#8221; Mitchell relates.</p>

<p>I will try not to list any spoilers in my review. I&#8217;m also not getting into any critique of their general touring style, preparation, and personality. The review will fixate on the following only:</p>
<ul>
<li>A.] Does this film make me wish I was on my loaded bike right now?</li>
<li>B.] Will I get that sick feeling of &#8216;Why, do I do this to myself?&#8217; that I get while on a tour?</li>
<li>C.] Do I get a sense of the conditions, geography, and issues that effect the tour?</li>
<li>D.] What I really liked about this film!</li>
</ul>
<h4>A.] Does this film make me wish I was on my loaded bike right now?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ll give that a yes. They communicate the small victories one feels when out on the road that seem to validate touring. The reaction to finding paved roads, the surprise of a mushroom vendor, making replacement parts materialize seemingly out of thin air, happening across &#8216;Jack The Ripper&#8217;, the security of pitching camp after a long day in the saddle are a few &#8216;small wins&#8217; that keep these guys fighting the rigors of daily miles. Their film communicates this ever important facet that touring is usually only 10% enjoyable and 90% hard work, with the caveat that the 10% far outweighs the 90% somehow making it worthwhile.</p>
<h4>B.] Will I get that sick feeling of &#8216;Why, do I do this to myself?&#8217; that I get while on a tour?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ll give this a yes also. They got the mechanical failure part a little too right. Langston spends a huge chunk of the film &#8220;macguyvering&#8221; bicycle fixes and keeping everyone believing in their equipment. They show the struggle of carrying food and water for weeks at a time always with a concern that they have enough. The dynamics of riding in a group are clear also. They lose a member, they argue in their tents, they huddle under a tarp in bad weather, they are swarmed with bugs, and it goes on. They really don&#8217;t pull any punches in representing the pitfalls of touring to a point where if you haven&#8217;t toured you may never want to. I don&#8217;t fault them in this regard as I feel that most people I know should probably not bicycle tour.</p>
<h4>C.] Do I get a sense of the conditions, geography, and issues that effect the tour?</h4>
<p>I do come away with a good sense of the remote location they are touring in. There are several &#8216;insect related&#8217; scenes that are hard to watch. Weather is always a concern while out on a bike and the difference between traveling on gravel vs. paved roads is a mainstay. They spend almost a week on the road between services several times and the concern is shared scene after scene. The geography takes it&#8217;s toll on the bikes and the riders. There are some &#8216;bug&#8217; related footage that will make anyone squeamish.</p>
<h4>D.] What I really liked about this film!!!</h4>
<p>I liked that they steered away from what most tourers do in that this was not a rolling &#8216;gear list&#8217; film. Too often online journals are all about &#8216;the gear&#8217;. These guys used a lot of what looked to be inexpensive equipment and relied on their &#8216;guts and heart&#8217; to make it to their destination.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the film was when one of the filmmakers talks about how anti-climactic finishing a tour is. I have always marveled at this. You spend 30 days fighting and just when you hit your stride it&#8217;s over. You roll into your destination and except for a short window of exuberance you almost don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Go spend $7 and support these guys. If you are anything like me YOU WANT people to go after and complete film projects like this.</p>
