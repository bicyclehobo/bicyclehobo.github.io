<p>So I&#8217;m surfing around on reddit and I keep seeing posts by user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/tiredofitdotca" target="_blank">tiredofitdotca</a> who is providing a good deal of helpful info. I visit his website <a href="http://www.tiredofit.ca/" target="_blank">TiredOfI.T!</a> and I read perhaps the best breakdown of a <a href="http://www.tiredofit.ca/2011/03/19/pedal-powered-electronics-charging-system/" target="_blank">dynohub to laptop charging set up, usage, and experience</a> that exists online. I also see that he has written a book.</p>
<p>I already feel an affinity for the guy as we both work in I.T. and we are both bicycle tourists; however, he has taken the plunge that I have not yet dared to. A full time bicycle tourist riding around and web publishing his travels. It&#8217;s as if he stole my idea before I had it. I&#8217;m jealous but at the same time I want to read his new book.</p>
<h4><i><a href="http://www.tiredofit.ca/book/" target="_blank">TIRED OF I.T! – HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BICYCLE</a></i></h4>
<p>I buy the book for 12 bucks american. <a href="http://www.tiredofit.ca/book/" target="_blank">I buy it right from his site</a> to make sure that he gets the maximum profit margin for his work product. I download it and toss it on the ipad. So far no issues.</p>
<p>It should be noted that I purchased &#8220;<a href="http://bicyclehobo.com/riding-north-movie-review/index.html" title="“Riding North” – Movie Review">Riding North &#8211; The Movie</a>&#8221; on Dave&#8217;s recomendation. That was well worth $7 so can Dave possibly go 2 for 2?</p>
<p>I get comfortable and prepared to follow Edgar Allen Poe&#8217;s advice in &#8220;<i><b>THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION</b></i>&#8221; that states on page 163-164: </p>
<p><b>If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and every thing like totality is at once destroyed.</b></p>
<p>That quote is a lot to digest but it is really simple so give it another shot.</p>
<p>Let me recap: It&#8217;s saturday morning. I have a pot of coffee and Dave&#8217;s book, I&#8217;m in a comfy outfit and on a comfy chair. BANG! Cover to cover in one sitting. 379 pages&#8230;unity of impression comprehended.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who: works in I.T., is a Bicycle Tourist or Adventure Traveler, and anyone who struggles with their role in modern society. Good job Dave I thoroughly got my $12 investment back.</p>
<h3>What I liked about the book:</h3>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a book about bicycle touring as much as it is a book about life, and how life sometime snaps you in the face like a rogue wave and how sometimes it parts like the Red Sea. Dave has had an interesting life with a good deal of twists and turns. He shares a great deal about himself in an effort to describe the impact his travels on the bike have meant to him. He is more courageous than I am as I hide behind my bicyclehobo moniker with no intention of crossing this fourth wall.</p>
<p>I enjoyed that this is a story with a beginning, middle and end and NOT a sputtering of daily mileage totals and equipment lists. You know exactly what I mean if you spend as much time as I do on bike touring blogs and journals.</p>
<p>Dave is the only person who seemingly uses a GPS specifically to get lost.</p>
<p>Dave doesn&#8217;t hold back on who he is and how he is. You get a real sense of the Author and his struggles.</p>
<p>The photos are great and exist as a bonus to the story. My one issue with the ebook was that they are fixed in landscape mode and when I turned my ipad to reorient them they shifted as well. There is one section that is photo heavy towards the end of the book. For a second I was caught in an infinite loop of turning my iPad back and forth. I couldn&#8217;t resist turning my head sideways and I woke up with a sore neck. It was after all a long day of reading. I always preferred a book to be an actual paper book so rather than a complaint this just helped to solidify my existing opinion. I&#8217;m not sure what Edgar Allen Poe would think about the iPad, and reading a book on it, but I am sure it would be an extreme reaction pro or con. The sore neck cleared up within a day.</p>
<p>This was written during a bicycle tour. Pretty impressive.</p>
<p>In conclusion I give <i><b><a href="http://www.tiredofit.ca/book/" target="_blank">TIRED OF I.T! – HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BICYCLE</a></b></i> a big thumbs up. It&#8217;s an adventure written by a true adventurer. Thanks for the read Dave!</p>
