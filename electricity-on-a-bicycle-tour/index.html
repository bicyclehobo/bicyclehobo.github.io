<p>On my last tour I employed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NYNRJC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007NYNRJC&linkCode=as2&tag=bicyclehobo-20">Brunton Explorer foldable compact solar panel charger</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bicyclehobo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B007NYNRJC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and back up battery to keep my smartphone, camera, and hardrive charged. I was able to stay powered up throughout my trip and never once was without power for my media kit. The downfall was that T-Mobile seemingly had no service from Phoenix, AZ until I neared Denver, CO, perhaps the best part of my trip. I was able to capture media but had to rely on wifi to publish in many places throughout my trip.</p>

<p>Another downfall I had was the media kit itself had way too many pieces, weighed too much, and took up too much space.</p>
<p>Left to right: Bungees [stuff sack] to attach solar panel to pannier bag, Brunton back up battery, camera battery charger, smartcard reader hard drive, 3 USB cords and a headset/mic cord, below sits my Brunton Explorer solar panel. I would stuff it all into the orange stuff sack. It&#8217;s cumbersome and heavy. The only thing I am taking from this set up is the back up battery. A full charge of this can charge a smartphone twice and have a little left over to add an additional 10-20% charge.</p>

<p>In it&#8217;s place will be a Son 28 Dynohub and one smartphone. I can&#8217;t wait to see what is available in smartphones 8 months from now.</p>
