<p>This campsite in the photo was a welcome one. I had just climbed up and out of the desert from Phoenix and into the mountains near Payson, Arizona. The day started in a beautiful &#8216;cactus forest&#8217; desert at an elevation of 1,140 feet and ended in a much cooler piney mountain landscape at 5000 feet. Located at the base of the Mongolian Rim and well inside the Tonto Natural Bridge State Park.

<p>Dispersed camping is legal camping in the wilderness where there are usually no pre configured campgrounds and services. Normally I find these types of campsites on State or Federal owned lands set away from large population centers. Sometimes they may have centrally located services like running water and/or a pit toilet. Colorado, Arizona, New Yorkâ€¦In every state of the United States it&#8217;s very easy to find free and legal camping. You can find Dispersed Camping opportunities throughout the National Forests, National Parks, and Bureau of Land Management tracts. There is usually a small set of rules, time limits, seasons, and sometimes one needs to register. Europe has it&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam" title="Freedom to roam" target="_blank">Freedom to Roam</a>&#8216; laws. Non compliance of these simple rules shifts you to <a href="http://bicyclehobo.com/stealth-camping/index.html" title="Stealth Camping">Stealth Camping</a> mode. The rules are easy to find and follow. There is plenty of legal, majestic, free camping available to everyone all around us.</p>
<p>I enjoy the solitude and primitive experience of camping away from developed campgrounds and other campers. Sure it results in more work for the adventurer and more equipment needed. Since you are OUTSIDE of a designated campground you will probably NOT have toilets, picnic tables, trash cans, treated water, and fire grates. The rules are usually consistent with making sure you are a certain distance from established trails, fire roads, lakes, streams, rivers, etc.</p>
<p>There are extra responsibilities and skills that are necessary for dispersed camping. Can you protect your food? Can you purify water? Can you have a campfire? Do you need a bear canister? Do you have a way to dig a hole to go to the bathroom? Do you know the principles of &#8216;<a href="http://lnt.org/" title="Leave No Trace">Leave No Trace</a>&#8216;?</p>
<p>Most Federal and State lands have clear easy to read instructions found here that outline dispersed camping opportunities:</p>

<p>This was a spectacular campsite on Lizard Head Pass, elevation 10,222 feet. It&#8217;s located 12 miles south of Telluride. At the top of the pass there are several fire roads off to the east and the west. This was one of my greatest views I have ever camped under. It was breathtaking. It was also really cold in early August with the temperatures dipping under 40 degrees F. This is the best example of dispersed camping I can project. I was really psyched to make it all the way to Telluride, CO but after speaking to a few locals in Rico, Co they gave me some good hints on how best to enjoy my evening. The ride was only about 60 miles but it was highlighted by a rainbow as I neared the top of the pass and a picture perfect campsite. You really couldn&#8217;t ask for a better bicycle touring experience than this.</p>

<p>I was right up in there. Camping with a million dollar view for free. Here is the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/j9CyE" title="Lizard Head Pass" target="_blank">Lizard head Pass on a google map</a>.</p>
<img class="responsive-image" src="http://bicyclehobo.com/img/lizard-head-pass-map.jpg" alt="dispersed camping" />
<p>Some simple guideline to follow:</p>
<h2>Picking a Dispersed C ampingCampsite</h2>
<p>If you are going to an area where others have camped before, pick a site that&#8217;s been used before. The impact of new campsites on plants, soil and wildlife is extreme so use existing campsites to reduce your impact on the natural setting. If there is no existing campsite, then follow these Leave No Trace guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camp on bare soil if possible, to avoid damaging or killing plants and grass.</li>
<li>Do NOT camp within 200 feet of any water source. Bring something to carry water the 200 feet back to camp.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t camp in the middle of a clearing or meadow. Hide for a truly &#8220;primative&#8221; setting. It&#8217;s way more fun. I always try for maximum cover where nobody will see me and out of any game trails.</li>
<li>Look for good natural drainage. Do not dig or build anything.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plan Ahead and Prepare for Dispersed Camping</h2>
<ul>
<li>Know the rules and regulations. These websites really do have great, easy to find information. I will bet there is a great spot near you:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.blm.gov/" title="Bureau of Land Management">U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nps.gov/index.htm" title="U.S. National Park Service" target="_blank">U.S. National Park Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/" title="U.S. Forest Service" target="_blank">U.S. Forest Service</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Always be ready for weather, hazards, and emergencies.</li>
<li>Avoid the high seasons to have the best time.</li>
<li>Visit in small groups. Split up if you are bigger than 5 people.</li>
<li>Strip down packaging of foods to reduce waste that you will need to carry out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get the Lay of the Land</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a look around and take your time selecting your site. Start looking early so you can find a good natural campsite. The best sites are rarely found in a hurried rush.</li>
<li>Camping at least 200 feet from lakes and streams.</li>
<li>Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dispose of Waste Properly</h2>
<ul>
<li>Police your campsite and pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter. Even the toilet paper and hygiene products.</li>
<li>You dig a small hole to go poopie in. It&#8217;s called a cathole. A small garden trowel works really well &#8211; 6 to 8 inches deep. Be at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails. Cover it in dirt and then scatter some leaves and woods debris on top. Like a cat would. Bring some prunes and keep things regular.</li>
<li>Any washing [yourself, dishes, etc.] carry water at least [again!] 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use a tiny amount of biodegradable soap. I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00120VWJ0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00120VWJ0&linkCode=as2&tag=bicyclehobo-20">Dr. Bronner&#8217;s Pure-Castile Soap</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bicyclehobo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00120VWJ0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> or my <a href="http://bicyclehobo.com/hygiene-on-bicycle-tour/index.html" title="Hygiene on Bicycle Tour" target="_blank">Hygiene Kit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minimize Campfire Impacts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Substitute a lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle. Hobo wood stoves are great when you need the feel of a fire but with minimal impact.</li>
<li>Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires.</li>
<li>Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that are easily obtained. You don&#8217;t have to have a huge stack of wood to get a nice comfy fire going.</li>
<li>Do not leave visual evidence that a fire was ever started. Douse with water and stir the ashes to extinguish. Before you leave use your cathole trowel and completely turn the earth over the area of your fire. Scatter natural leaves and forest debris on top. Walk away and look back. Make sure it is not noticeable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Respect Wildlife</h2>
<ul>
<li>Observe wildlife from a distance. They will figure it all out one day, revolt and charge. We deserve it so watch out.</li>
<li>Feeding wildlife is always a poor idea. Expect it to go wrong.</li>
<li>Store food and trash securely as per the rules of where you are at [Yosemite Natl. Park requires a bear canister].</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of wonderful places that can accommodate Dispersed Camping free and legally. I favor this type of camping above <a href="http://bicyclehobo.com/stealth-camping/index.html" title="Stealth Camping">Stealth Camping</a> because of the legalities involved. I will still <a href="http://bicyclehobo.com/stealth-camping/index.html" title="Stealth Camping">Stealth Camp</a> when I need to and I think the guidelines shown here are a good idea regardless of how and where you are camping.</p>
